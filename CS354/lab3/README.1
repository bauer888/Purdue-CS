I modified process.h to now contain the constants MINPROCPRIO, MAXPROCPRIO, INITPROCPRIO, QUANTUMIO, and QUANTUMCPU.
I also modified clkhandler() to lower the priority of the current process if its time slice is depleted as well as change the value of a new process table field that I made (proctype) to differentiate CPU bound behavior (depleting a time slice) and IO bound behavior (calling sleep). The value is changed based on whether the time slice was depleted or if sleepms() was called.
I also modified resched() to make sure the current process's priority stays within the bounds of MINPROCPRIO and MAXPROCPRIO. I also check the value of proctype to determine whether the current process is behaving as a CPU bound process or an IO bound process. If it is behaving as a CPU bound process, prnumdepl is incremented and prnumvol is incremented if the process is behaving like an IO bound process. The last thing I did in resched was update the old process's CPU usage and started the new process's CPU usage.
I modified sleepms() to change the value of proctype showing that the process is behaving as an IO bound process. Lastly, I incremented the priority of the current process in sleepms().
